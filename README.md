## javascript-challenge  
The challenge is to write code in pure JavaScript, HTML, CSS and D3.js that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided by `ALIENS-R-REAL`.  They have collected all of the eye-witness reports of UFO sightings.

The goal is to make the information easier to search for by the dedicated followers of ARR. Currently the collection of data is too large to search through manually.
